# Mac Setup
Setup for new Macs or Linux machines in case of an EMP attack. Installs: systems, installations, dotfiles, Sublime Text 3. Run shell via a click.


## Instructions

Download the executable `setup` and **RIGHT-CLICK** on it to run. It will download the [Sublime Settings](https://github.com/kengz/sublime_settings) repo to `~/Documents/` for you to setup Sublime too.

If you want `LaTeX` and `Octave`, then run the `setup_extra` too. The `LaTeX` here is `basicTex`, which is just 100Mb.
